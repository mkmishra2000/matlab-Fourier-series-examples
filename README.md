# matlab-Fourier-series-examples
I got few interesting question in signal and system assignment and i wrote MatLab code on them. It increased my 
understanding on series and working on matlab. So hopefully, it will help others.

Q 1. Write and execute a MATLAB program to find the Fourier series coefficients. Plot the coefficients,
magnitude, and phase spectrum.
see image file git_example_1:


Q 2. Write a MATLAB program to find Fourier series of f(x) = x, −2 < x < 2, f(x+4) = f(x)
and plot the magnitude and phase.


26. Write a MATLAB program for signal shown in git_example_2 and plot its magnitude and phase
for 25 coefficients.


27. Write a MATLAB program to find Fourier series of f(x) = |x|, −2 < x < 2, f(x + 4) =
f(x) and plot the magnitude and phase.


28. Use MATLAB to perform symbolic Fourier series calculation of the following signal. Plot
both the amplitude and phase of the harmonics.

29. Consider
f(x) =   {  x,      0 < x < pi
         { pi,     pi < x < 2*pi
(12)
Use MATLAB to perform symbolic Fourier series calculation of the above signal. Plot both the
amplitude and phase of the harmonics.


30. Find the Fourier series representation of the signal shown and plot the coefficients, magnitude,
and phase for
(a) 10 coefficients (b) 30 coefficients (c) 50 coefficients
